# UGV Autonomous Drive
Autonomous drive software for UGV, written for OpenPilot Revolution using the airbourne_f4 library for hardware abstraction.

Changed to Arduino Nano for simplicity of use. Using Hc-12 as antenna, and a UBLOX NEO-M8N for GPS signal. We are using the Arduino TinyGPS++ and the pre-installed SoftwareSerial libraries.
